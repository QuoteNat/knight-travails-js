A pathfinding algorithm for finding the shortest route for a chess knight between two coordinates on a chessboard implemented in JS. `index.js` contains examples while `knight.js` contains the implementation.

```
$ node index.js 
Path from [0,0] to [3,3]
The knight made it in 2 moves! Here is the path:
[0,0]
[2,1]
[3,3]
Path from [0,0] to [7,7]
The knight made it in 6 moves! Here is the path:
[0,0]
[2,1]
[4,2]
[6,3]
[7,5]
[5,6]
[7,7]
```
